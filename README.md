# üõ†Ô∏è Extruder Project

This project involves building an extruder using a **Nema 17 stepper motor** with a **gearbox ratio of 5.18:1**. The motor is paired with a **single screw auger extruder** for consistent material flow. 

## Key Components
- **Motor**: Nema 17 Stepper Motor with 5.18:1 gearbox ratio.
- **Hopper**: A custom hopper made using a **PVC pipe reducer** from **2 inch to 1/2 inch**.
- **Extruder Type**: Single screw auger extruder to handle the extrusion process.

## Features
- The setup ensures precise control over extrusion speed and flow using the stepper motor and gearbox combination.
- The single screw auger design provides steady material feed for the extrusion process.
- The hopper is designed to hold and channel the material into the extruder efficiently.

üîß **This extruder is perfect for applications requiring steady, controlled extrusion of materials like mortar or similar viscous substances.**
